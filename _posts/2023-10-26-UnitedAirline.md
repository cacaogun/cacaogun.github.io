title: United Airlines and AWS Backup to Protect Data from Ransomware Events    
---

Ransomware is continuing as the number one threat to the data across all Industries. There have been a sizable number of Ransomware attacks in 2021 with an increase in volume (by 37 percent) during the ongoing pandemic. SonicWall recorded an all-time high of 78.4 million ransomware attacks globally in June 2021.
Ransomware is a destructive threat to your data and in this blog, I will discuss various techniques of AWS Backup that can help you to sustain Ransomware attacks on your AWS workload.

Some Ransomware Artifacts
One of the recent reports says that the U.S. government gives ransomware attacks the same level of priority as terrorism. For any organization, Ransomware attacks can have a highly staggering impact.
American oil pipeline system Colonial Pipeline, Acer, Chicago-based CNA Financial Corp, Kia Motors and many Indian companies are the victims of Ransomware attacks of 2021.  

What is Ransomware attack
Ransomware is malicious code designed by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to systems and data and encrypt that data to block access by legitimate users. Once ransomware has locked users out of their systems and encrypted their sensitive data, cybercriminals demand a ransom to provide a decryption key to unlock the blocked systems and decrypt data. In theory, if the ransom is paid within the allotted time, systems and data are decrypted and made available once again and normal operations continue. However, if the ransom demand is not satisfied, organizations risk permanent destruction or public-facing data leaks controlled by the attacker. That there is no rule of the game.
